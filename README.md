Hello Quasi-Geostrophy enthusiast,

Here's a set of codes that are solving an eigenvalue Thermal-QG and QG problem : A.X = c.B.X. This kind of problem is directly derived from the linear theory of TQG and QG PV conservation : you can have a look on it in the pdf called "TQG notes" in this repository


The version 2 is the actual version of TQG solve 1D TARANIS 

The version 3 is the actual version of TQG solve 2D JULIE 

The bis in the name means that the script solves QG and TQG cases.

The codes that are in ''KERNEL_...'' folders are ready to
test different values of Theta0/U0, F1star, Lstar ...

The code TQG solve named ''JULIE'' is a 2D adaption 
of the TQG solve v2 bis ''TARANIS''


Enjoy !
